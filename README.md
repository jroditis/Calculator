This is where I actually feel like I kind of hit my stride. Kind of. 
At the very least, this is where I feel like I hit my stride with using Claude and knowing what to ask for. While I found that Claude having a similar 'voice' to mine (polite to a fault) meant that I was able to interface with it easier and generally get what I wanted, this was where I really found the "language pattern" that got me what I was looking for (record of that in the supplement). 
Were I to do this again, I think I'd try to make something a little more complex, but since this class really is my first time inferfacing with coding period, I'm trying to be forgiving to myself.
